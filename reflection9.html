    <h1>Reflection 9: Data Visualization Reflection</h1>
    <p>For my data visualization project, I decided to focus on something that felt relevant to all of us right now: the study habits of Hunter students with finals week approaching. I created a Google Form with five simple questions and ended up getting eleven responses. Even though the number was small, it still gave me a glimpse into how different students prepare, manage their time, and feel during this stressful period. Once I gathered the responses, I organized the data and started thinking about the best way to bring it to life visually.</p>
   <p>Using Adobe Illustrator was one of my favorite parts of the assignment. I played around with different graph types: column graphs, pie charts, and bar graphs until I found the ones that communicated the information most clearly. Illustrator gave me the freedom to adjust colors, spacing, and shapes in a way that made everything feel more intentional and readable. Surprisingly, for an assignment that was supposed to be fairly simple, I found myself really enjoying the creative process behind it. I also took an extra step to make my final layout feel polished. I divided my artboard into sections using shapes and color-coding so each graph had its own space while still looking connected to the overall theme. It ended up looking clean, organized, and honestly pretty aesthetic.</p>
<p>Overall, this project taught me that presenting data is more than just showing numbers; it’s about telling a story. I learned that good design can make even small sets of information meaningful, and I appreciated how much creativity data visualization actually allows.</p>
