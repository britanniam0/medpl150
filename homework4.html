<p>For my photomontages, I explored two major social issues: gun violence and unequal access to healthcare. The first montage, Healthcare Inequality, focuses on how money and privilege affect the access to medical care that people receive. I layered images of hospital rooms, medical equipment, and stacks of money to show the tension between wealth and well-being. "Health is wealth," as they say, but perhaps it is the other way around. The overlapping visuals suggest that healthcare is not only about healing; it's also about cost.
My second photomontage, Gun Violence, symbolizes the growing loss of innocence caused by gun violence. I used the image of a memorial to represent the lives lost, blending in a toy truck to suggest the young victims of shootings. The contrast between the peaceful background and the dark subject matter emphasizes how ordinary places can easily become sites of tragedy.<br> 
 I created both pieces in Photoshop using non-destructive editing with layer masks and adjustment layers. For the gun violence montage, I masked the toy truck into the scene and adjusted the brightness/contrast to make it blend naturally with the memorial background. As if it were left as a tribute. I lowered the opacity and used the soft brush feature to create subtle transitions. For the Healthcare montage, I experimented with blending modes, mainly Luminosity, to merge textures of money and hospital imagery without overpowering one another. I also used hue/saturation adjustment to balance tones and unify the composition. All of my images came from Wikimedia Commons, allowing me to focus on symbolic visual storytelling while using real photographs.
