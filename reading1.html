    <h1>Reflection on Susan Sontag's "In Plato's Cave"</h1>
<p>To capture images and create graphics is to try to freeze a moment in time, to take something fleeting and hold it still long enough to look at it again. A photograph or a drawing is not the thing itself but a representation. When we press the shutter of a camera or sketch a figure, we are choosing which part of reality to capture and which to leave out. In a way, creating images is both honest and selective: it reveals the truth of what was there, but it is never the whole truth, as it is limited by the reality of being able to select the moment you want captured. It is a piece of reality transformed into something that can be shared, possessed, or remembered.</p>
  <p>Photography, in particular, has profoundly shaped modern perception. Sontag argues that photographs function like Plato’s shadows on the cave wall, offering only partial and mediated views of the world. Yet because of their apparent realism, they often become confused with the truth itself. A photograph suggests that the world is more “available” than it truly is, giving viewers the illusion of knowledge and possession. Tourists, for instance, may experience travel primarily through their cameras, but never in the actual moment. They accumulate images as proof of their journeys while missing the deeper realities of the places they visit. Thus, photography alters not only how we see but also how we behave, turning life itself into material for images.</p>
  <p>Sontag further emphasizes the power dynamics embedded in the act of photographing. To take a picture, in her words, is a form of appropriation. The camera grants the photographer authority: the power to decide what is worth seeing, how it will be framed, and how others will encounter it. The language of photography: “shooting”, “capturing”, “aiming”, highlights its aggressive undertones. This control can objectify subjects, freezing them as images that exist independently of their lived experience. For Sontag, this “sublimated murder” suggests that photographs symbolically possess their subjects, reducing them to visual artifacts.</p>
  <p>Yet photography is not only about possession or detachment. It also carries the potential to move viewers, to generate empathy, and at times to inspire moral or political action. Historic images, such as one that is now burnt into my brain like the little naked Napalm girl during the Vietnam War, demonstrate photography’s availability to mobilize collective outrage. However, Sontag cautions that such effects are fragile. With repetition, shocking or outrageous images can lose their force; the audience can become numb or even perversely fascinated by scenes of suffering. Photographs required context, interpretation, and conscious reflection.</p>
 <p>If I were to represent today’s moment through photography or art, I might take a picture of an ordinary scene: people waiting for the bus, someone scrolling on their phone, or even aesthetics, and pair it with words. The images and text can remind us that any moment is worth capturing. Sontag argues that photographs are never neutral; they always shape our perception. By pairing thoughtful texts to photographs, we can add back some context and reflection that a picture might lack.
In the end, creating images is a way of saying: This mattered. This was here. Look with me. Photography may not capture the full reality, but it opens a door to seeing, a token or souvenir of a specific event or moment you want to hold on to and cherish, which is also why I never leave home without my Polaroid.</p>
