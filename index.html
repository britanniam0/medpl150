    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p1>My name is Britannia, and I am a second-year nursing student with aspirations of becoming a neonatal nurse practitioner and opening my own practice one day. While my path is rooted in science and healthcare, I’ve always had a love for creativity and expression. I also dream of traveling the world, experiencing different cultures, lifestyles and exploring global art.Although I don’t have formal experience in media arts, I took a few visual arts classes in early high school. Those courses were more hands-on and physical focused on painting, drawing, and building projects from scratch. One of my favorite creations was a volcano I built and erupted during the online portion of school. I loved the freedom to be creative without the pressure of perfection.</p1>
    <p2>This class will be introducing me to a very different kind of art; digital and interactive. It will unfamiliar at first, but I will be taking Professor Miranda’s advice: to see this class as an escape from all my others and also as a fun experience while learning. Hopefully this mindset will help me push past doubt and focus on expressing myself through a new medium. The kind of art I enjoy creating reflects the imperfections of the world. I’m drawn to how flaws and unfinished edges tell real stories about growth, change, and the human experience. I will try to incorporate as much of my passions as I am allowed and I hope through this class I will take away essential life lessons, new hobbies and interests and most importantly, well rounded new knowledge of this course.</p2>
