    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p1>My name is Britannia, and I am a second-year nursing student with aspirations of becoming a neonatal nurse practitioner and opening my own practice one day. While my path is rooted in science and healthcare, I’ve always had a love for creativity and expression. My favorite form of media art would be photography. Photography allows me to freeze a moment, which is why I love taking pictures as a way to look back at that particular moment in time. I would love to learn the professional side of things. I am also interested in documentaries and animation. I also do painting sometimes as a way of slowing things down when I’m anxious or overwhelmed.

      Although I don’t have formal experience in media arts, I took a few visual arts classes in early high school. Those courses were more hands-on and physically focused on painting, drawing, and building projects from scratch. One of my favorite creations was a volcano I built and erupted during the online portion of school. I loved the freedom to be creative without the pressure of perfection. I see art as a means of escape without being confined to tight restrictions. I want my work to feel like a sense of peace and immediate happiness. I also intend for my work to reflect the human experience: imperfection and growth. I have no experience with using the editing software required for this class or the other apps; however, I am excited to learn, and maybe there is a career in art for me in the near future.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Before creating my first website, I felt both intimidated and excited. I didn’t know what to expect, but I imagined it would be a simple, step-by-step process. However, once I got started, I quickly realized just how many layers and details are involved. The process wasn’t necessarily hard, but it was definitely confusing and very specific. One small change in the code could throw off everything, and I found myself going in circles at times trying to figure out what went wrong.

Although I’m a beginner, this project made me revisit coding skills from my computer science class, which I found challenging. While creating this webpage, I struggled most with spotting mistakes, especially when adding my headshot. However, I realized that persistence and learning from errors are essential in developing web skills.

This experience helped me realize how much time, patience, and effort go into creating even the most beautiful and simple-looking websites. It gave me a new respect for web designers and digital creators. While I haven’t perfected my skills yet, I know I’ve taken the first important step, and things will only get better from here. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this new creative space.
