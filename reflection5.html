    <h1>Reflection 5:Illustrating Awareness: A Reflective Insight</h1>
    <p>In this assignment, we expanded our understanding of photomontage by incorporating vector elements created in Adobe Illustrator. Learning Illustrator presented a new challenge and required me to step outside my comfort zone, as I had to adapt to a different design workflow and develop new technical skills. Despite the learning curve, integrating vectors with my photomontage helped me enhance both the visual impact and the message of my work.
 <br>The social issue I chose to address was gun violence, specifically its impact on children. School shootings have become a recurring tragedy in the United States, and I believe this topic is both urgent and necessary to keep in public discussion. In my original photomontage, I featured a graveyard to symbolize the countless young lives lost, a toy truck to represent childhood innocence, and a sign urging us to protect children rather than the weapons harming them. Each visual element was selected to evoke emotion and communicate the seriousness of the issue.
<br>For the Illustrator component, I created cylindrical vector shapes to represent bullets, and added a red “Silent Aftermath” sign. The dark red color symbolizes the bloodshed and the heavy silence that follows such devastating events. I feel that the addition of these vector elements strengthened the overall composition and made the message more striking and memorable. Overall, this project allowed me to refine my artistic skills while using art as a tool for social awareness and advocacy.
