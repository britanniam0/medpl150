    <h1>Reflection 6: Where Color meets Emotion</h1>
    <p>For this project, I created two vector illustrations of eyes to visually express two emotions, sadness and anger, using complementary color schemes. Working in Adobe Illustrator pushed me to rely on shape, color, and line quality to communicate feelings, rather than drawing realistic features. This made me think more intentionally about how design choices can portray emotion in a simple but powerful way.
<br>For my sad eye illustration, I used a complementary pair of blue and orange. I wanted the blue to carry the emotional weight of sadness, so I placed it at the center of the eyes and used a softer, lighter blue highlight to show vulnerability. The orange shapes around the eye helped emphasize contrast and make the sadness more noticeable. I chose rounded, organic shapes and curved lines because they softened the expression and made the eyes look heavy and teary. Even the slight downward curves beneath the eyes helped create a sense of emotional exhaustion, which is how I often visualize sadness.
<br>My second piece focused on anger, using red and green as the complementary pair. I took a very different approach with this one. The shapes are sharper and more angular to show tension, and I used bold red strokes for the eyebrows to intensify the expression. The green surrounding the eyes added contrast, but I kept it strong enough to hold its own, so the design didn’t feel one-sided. The highlights in the pupil are small and intense, which, for me, captured the feeling of someone angry and focused.
<br>Creating both illustrations side-by-side showed me how much color and shape alone can shift emotional meaning. This project taught me that simplicity doesn’t limit expression; instead, it forces you to be intentional with every design choice. I learned how complementary colors can not only balance a piece visually but also strengthen the emotional message behind it.
