    <h1>Reflection 6: Where Color meets Emotion</h1>
    <p>For this project, I created a vector illustration of an eye using complementary colors to visually convey the emotion of sadness. Working in Adobe Illustrator challenged me to think more intentionally about shape, color, and composition, rather than relying on realistic details. By limiting myself to simple vector forms, I had to express emotion through minimalism, color theory, and design choices.

 <br>I chose blue and orange as my complementary color pair. Blue is traditionally associated with sadness, calmness, or melancholy, while orange is energetic and warm. Placing these opposites together helped amplify the emotional contrast in the artwork. The blue tones in the iris and pupil represent the core feeling of sadness, while the surrounding orange highlights emphasize the intensity of that emotional state. The choice of a lighter blue reflection adds depth and makes the eye appear more vulnerable and expressive.

<br>The shapes in the composition were intentionally rounded and organic to soften the design and avoid harsh lines. The curved upper shape, resembling an eyelid, contributes to the drooping, sorrowful expression. I kept the illustration abstract and symbolic rather than literal, allowing viewers to interpret the emotion through color and form. This process taught me how powerful simplicity can be in conveying meaning. Overall, creating this vector eye allowed me to explore color as an emotional language. Using complementary colors strengthened the visual impact of the piece and successfully conveyed the feeling of sadness in a clear, expressive way.
