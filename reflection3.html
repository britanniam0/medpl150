    <h1>Reflection 3: Exploring Depth of Field and Camera Filter Raw</h1>
    <p>This week, we picked up the cameras again, and this time, I felt less intimidated. We explored depth of field, both shallow and deep. I learned that a lower aperture lets in more light, resulting in a shallower depth of field where only one area is in focus. In some of my photos, I let in too much light, which created a slightly blurry effect. On the other hand, a higher aperture allows less light in and brings more of the image into focus, which I also observed in my results.
<br>We also dove back into Photoshop, and this time I felt more confident navigating the tools. I was secretly excited to experiment again. I enjoyed adjusting colors, experimenting with curves, and editing to bring the vision I had in mind to life. One of my favorite parts was creating artificial blur; what started as a mistake ended up looking really good, so I wouldn’t call it a mistake after all.
<br>With the Camera Raw filter, I made subtle but noticeable adjustments and took the time to crop and straighten my image to my liking. Overall, I’ll miss using the cameras and exploring their features. This week reignited my love for photography and sparked a new wave of creativity. I feel inspired to continue experimenting outside of this class. I also feel much more comfortable working in Photoshop, and I can see my improvement in both the photos I took and the edits I made.</p>
