    <h1>Reflection 1: Introduction to HTML</h1>

    <p>Before creating my first website, I felt both intimidated and excited. I didn’t know what to expect, but I imagined it would be a simple, step-by-step process. However, once I got started, I quickly realized just how many layers and details are involved. The process wasn’t necessarily hard, but it was definitely confusing and very specific. One small change in the code could throw off everything, and I found myself going in circles at times trying to figure out what went wrong.
Although I’m a beginner, this project made me revisit coding skills from my computer science class, which I found challenging. While creating this webpage, I struggled most with spotting mistakes, especially when adding my headshot. However, I realized that persistence and learning from errors are essential in developing web skills.
This experience helped me realize how much time, patience, and effort go into creating even the most beautiful and simple-looking websites. It gave me a new respect for web designers and digital creators. While I haven’t perfected my skills yet, I know I’ve taken the first important step, and things will only get better from here. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this new creative space.
