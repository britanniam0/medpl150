    <p>This image is formatted at 5*7, a classic print dimension often used in photography. Unlike widescreen, the 5*7 ratio feels more intimate and more commonly used for portraits or personal images. The different shape changes how the viewer focuses on the subject, drawing attention to details in a tighter frame.</p>
