    <h1>Reflection2: Photography + Photoshop Basics</h1>
    <p>When I first found out that Photography would be part of our curriculum, I was thrilled. I love taking pictures and being in them. Something is exciting about finding cute spots with beautiful aesthetics and snapping photos to capture the moment. In the lab, we were given DSLR cameras to explore and find inspiration. I did run into a few mishaps, but I managed to get the shots I needed, while also enjoying a mini photoshoot with me as the model, which was definitely the fun part.
After taking the photos, we moved on to editing them using Adobe Photoshop. I had no prior experience with the software, so it was a bit overwhelming at first, especially trying to keep up with classmates who already knew what they were doing. Still, learning the basics of both photography and Photoshop gave me a whole new appreciation for what goes into creating an image. It's not just about capturing what’s in front of you, but also making sure the lighting, angles, and composition are just right. We learned how to adjust aperture, shutter speed, and other camera settings; small changes that can completely shift the mood or meaning of a photo.
Photoshop added another layer of creativity. I used to think editing was just about fixing mistakes, but now I see it as a way to enhance and bring my vision to life. Adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and even curves showed me how powerful subtle edits can be. Overall, this experience taught me how photography and Photoshop go hand in hand to bring images to life, and I’m excited to keep learning and improving.
