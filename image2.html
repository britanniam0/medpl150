    <h1>Image 2 (1920*1080)</h1>
    <img src="img/Her Hair.jpg" alt="Her Hair" width="960" height="540">
    <p>This image is formatted at 1920*1080, which is a standard widescreen ratio. The wide aspect ratio makes it effective for presentations, websites, or digital projects, since it fills modern screens and desktops naturally. Working with this dimension made me more aware of how proportion and layout affect the way an audience views visual material.</p>
