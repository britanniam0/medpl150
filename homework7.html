<p>For my illustrated environment assignment, I chose the Statue of Liberty because it was the first landmark I dreamed of visiting when I migrated here, even though I still haven’t seen it in person. Reinterpreting such a major symbol visually was challenging at first, but once I got the hang of the tools and workflow, the process became easier, and even fun. I like that it gives off a cartoon-like style, simplifying shapes and exaggerating certain features to give the illustration a playful, vibrant feel. This approach allowed me to capture the monument’s iconic presence while still making it feel personal and imaginative.
