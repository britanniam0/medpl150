    <h1>Reflection 8: Blink Animation and Cut-Up Cinema</h1>
    <p>For my blink animation, I chose to use my sad eye illustration from Homework 6 and turn it into a more expressive animated sequence. Instead of only duplicating and adjusting one eyelid layer, I created five separate frames and drew new layers for each stage of the blink. I sketched the eye in three positions: halfway closed, almost closed, and fully closed, and then reversed the sequence so that the eye opened again with the help of Illustrator. This approach made the animation feel smoother and more natural because each stage was intentionally drawn rather than just shifted. After setting the frame delay to around 0.1–0.2 seconds, the blink looked realistic and captured the emotional tone of the original sad eye drawing. Looping it forever completed the effect and showed me how much personality can come from small adjustments in digital animation.
<br>For the Cut-Up Cinema assignment using Puppet Warp, I used a photo of myself turned backwards while I was on vacation, which gave the animation a fun and unexpected twist. I started by pinning down different joints on my body. Then, using Puppet Warp, I bent my arms and adjusted my posture to create playful, dance-like movements; it was super interesting for me. By duplicating each layer and slightly adjusting the Puppet Warp pins, I created a sequence that resembled a looping dance. This process was surprisingly enjoyable because it allowed me to exaggerate motion while still keeping the original photo recognizable.
   <br>Overall, both demos showed me how simple tools can transform still images into lively animations. Once I understood the steps, creating these GIFs became not only easier but genuinely fun.
